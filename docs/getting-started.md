# Getting Started with Wok

Wok is a tool to manage multiple git repositories simultaneously.

In a nut shell, Wok is a package manager for git submodules. You choose a repo which stores Wok Workspace configuration, add subrepos, and Wok will help you manage them in a way you expect from a package manager to do it.
