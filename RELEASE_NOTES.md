## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

### Technical Debt
- **Remote Detection**: Currently hardcoded to "origin" remote
- **Performance**: No parallel operations for large repositories
- **Progress Indicators**: No progress feedback for long operations

### Alpha Considerations
- **Real-world Testing**: Limited testing with actual multi-repo projects
- **Edge Cases**: Some complex git scenarios may need additional testing
- **Performance**: Large repositories may experience slower operations

## üîÆ Recommended Pre-Release Testing

### 1. Real-World Testing
- Test with actual multi-repo projects
- Verify workflow compatibility with existing git practices
- Test integration with CI/CD pipelines

### 2. Performance Testing
- Test with repositories containing large histories
- Verify memory usage with many submodules
- Test network operations with slow connections

### 3. Cross-Platform Testing
- Test on different operating systems
- Verify path handling on Windows
- Test with different git configurations

### 4. Integration Testing
- Test with various git hosting services (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
- Verify SSH and HTTPS authentication
- Test with different git versions

### 5. User Acceptance Testing
- Gather feedback from target users
- Test documentation clarity and completeness
- Verify command discoverability and usability

## üéØ Next Steps for Beta Release
